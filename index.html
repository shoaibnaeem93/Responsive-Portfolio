    <p>Hi, my name is Shoaib Naeem. I am 24 years old and live in Fremont,California. I went to school at San Jose State University and 
        I am currently learning web development. </p>

    <p>Im interested in sports, music, video games and kicking it with friends. My favorite sport is soccer, which probably accounts
        for 50% of my life. I play as a central attacking midfielder or a winger (both right and left). My favorite soccer
        team is Real Madrid. I like and listen to all kinds of music...even a little bit of country. I dont have any preference between
        different genres so as long as it sounds good and I enjoy it. I cannot exactly label one band or musician as my favorite artist, 
        since my listening mood varies from time to time. Video games have been a huge part of my childhood. The first video game 
        console I remember getting was the Nintendo 64 and I rememeber playing "Super Mario" and "Mario Kart" for hours on end. 
        A few video games titles that I like are: Mario series, Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy 7, 8, 10 and 15, Zelda, and no surprise FIFA Soccer series.
        I really enjoy having a good time with family and friends. Whether it be chilling at someone's house or travelling together, being with friends and friends is always
        a good time.
